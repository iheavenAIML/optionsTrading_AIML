_**Scope of the project / Research Question**_:

Under which circumstances an options trader should use a straddle trading strategy based on the Russell 2000 index performance and imminent market disruptions like FOMC announcements and other 'black swan' events?

Given the potential for high volatility and unpredictable outcomes associated with such events, the trader faces the challenge of determining whether to execute a straddle trade.

This decision hinges on analyzing historical correlations between the Russell 2000 and market disruptions, evaluating the magnitude of anticipated volatility, and assessing risk tolerance.

The trader must navigate the complex interplay of market forces to decide whether the potential gains from a straddle position outweigh the associated risks, ensuring informed and strategic decision-making in volatile market conditions.

_**Executive Summary | Recommendations**_:

AI modeling and Data Analysis point directly to the following recommendations:
1. options traders should establish a long straddle position on the Russell 2000 index on the eve of the FOMC announcement, preferably 2-3 trading days in advance (the calendar of FOMC announcements can be viewed here: https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm)
2. the most closely watched impactful features should be "Range" and "Volume" of Russell 2000; it appears that the trigger threshold lays @ $6B trading volume - this is when moves 'up' and 'down' occur with significant volatility which offsets the price of establishing the straddle trade
3. the side observation revealed that the move 'down' is much more volatile than the move 'up'
4. in the majority of cases (81%) data is 'range-bound' and that suggests selling a straddle or strangle ... please find a detailed technical analysis here: https://github.com/iheavenAIML/optionsTrading_AIML/blob/main/optionsTrading_classification_russell2000_frequency_B.ipynb
5. furthermore, out of four AI models used for the classification of index' move 'up', 'down', or 'range-bound' (KNeighborsClassifier, LogisticRegression, DecisionTreeClassifier, and Support Vector Machines) we recommend using the LogisticRegression model for predicting Russell 2000 movement
6. at the time of analysis and the end date of the available data (March 15, 2024) the result of time series forecasting using a trained AutoRegressive Moving Average model suggests that the Russell 2000 index has been at the bottom of its range-bound oscillations is due for an upward movement (see in-depth AI analysis here <link to notebook here>) - this can be observed as a correct forecast looking at the index chart for the last several weeks
7. overall, it appeared that the 'Low' (coefficient = 0.205117), 'High' (coefficient = 0.205413), and 'Open' (coefficient = 0.587922) have the biggest impact on the 'Closing priceâ€™
8. lastly, using LinearRegression model options traders will be able to predict the closing price of the Russell 2000 index with MSE = 0.000593 which indicates good model performance <link <link to notebook here>


_**Key Steps Performed During Analysis**_:

1. we've explored the data by loading it and analyzing the dataset using functions like `head()`, `info()`, `describe()` among other Panda's build-in methods
2. we've examined each column individually to understand the type and relevance of data it contained
3. we've identified missing values (39 in total) in the dataset and imputed values based on domain knowledge and its potential impact on the analysis
4. we've looked into any inconsistencies, errors, or anomalies in the data (this could've included duplicate records, incorrect data types, inconsistent formatting, or unexpected values)
5. we've explored relationships between different features in the dataset by utilizing visualization techniques like scatter plots, histograms, and correlation matrices
6. we've incorporated financial markets domain knowledge to guide our exploration
7. and, finally we've kept track of our observations, findings, and any actions taken during the data exploration process and presented them in this very README.md
